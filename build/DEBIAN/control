Description: graphical network monitoring
 jNetMap is a network monitoring and documentation tool. 
 It will (with some help from you) draw a representation of the network. 
 It pings all registered devices every x minutes, updating their 
 status according to the result of the ping. Alternatively you can also 
 monitor a specific port, such as port 80 for webservers. 
 Available devices are green, unavailable devices are red.
